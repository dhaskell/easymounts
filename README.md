# Easymounts
Initial repo for a new MC Spigot plugin I'll be working on that enhances the way mounts work in game.


### The Basics

The plugin will detect the use of special saddle items. These will be regular saddles but have a customized name as well as stats.

Example:
```
	The Black Knights Mighty Steed
	Health: 30
	Speed: 1.35
	Jump: 0.7
	Armor: Iron
	Color: Black
	
```

These items will summon/dismiss your mount when used allowing you to keep it safely in your inventory.

I can add custom crafting recipies into the game to allow a saddle to be upgraded. For instance placing it in a crafting bench with horse armor will upgrade it's armor, surrounding it in dye will alter it's coloration and I'm also tossing around the idea of active effects like regeneration and fire resist.

Later versions will include mules, zombie and skeletal horses and possibly crazy things like ender dragons (that fly!).
